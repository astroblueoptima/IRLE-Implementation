# Intelligent Reinforcement Learning Environment (IRLE) 🧠

Harness the power of dynamic environments with IRLE. Adapt to your agent's learning pace, ensuring constant challenges and improved adaptability. IRLE introduces obstacles based on agent performance, making the learning process more engaging and robust.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Dynamic Challenges**: Introduce obstacles based on the agent's success rate, ensuring the agent is constantly challenged.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Agents trained in IRLE adapt faster to new challenges due to their exposure to changing environments.
- **Enhanced Robustness**: IRLE encourages agents to learn diverse strategies, improving their robustness and adaptability.
- **Simplified Setup**: Easy-to-use environment setup and integration, making it suitable for both RL beginners and experts.
